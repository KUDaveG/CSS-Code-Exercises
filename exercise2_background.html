    <!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: Backgrounds
    In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to apply backgrounds to different sections of the layout.
    CSS can be placed in a separate file, in the <head> section of this document, or inline.

    Try these things:
    1) Go to subtlepatterns.com and select a pattern to apply to the background of the page.
       Make sure it repeats in all directions.

    2) Give the main <div> a height and width. Add a colored background to that <div>.
    Bonus: center that <div> on the page!

    3) Highlight the two words "mank" and "ind" with the same color.

    Bonus points: Use the Google box and figure out how to apply a gradient as a background color!

      <div class="main_div">
            <p>"Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it’s made up of two separate words – <span class="mank">"mank"</span> and <span class="mank">"ind"</span>. What do these words mean ? It’s a mystery, and that’s why so is mankind."</p>

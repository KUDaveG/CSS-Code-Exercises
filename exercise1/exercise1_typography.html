<!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: Typography
In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to update type styles.
CSS can be placed in a separate file, in the <head> section of this document, or inline.

Try these things:
1) Create some typographic hierarchy by styling the title, author, and paragraphs.

2) Underline the underlined words by giving them a class and applying the style.

3) Highlight the background of the highlighted text with the color "#ffff00"

4) Center all of the text on the page

Bonus points: Install a Google Font and update the fonts using two different faces.

        <h1>Look for Me</h1>
        <h3>BY TED KOOSER</h3>

        <p>Look for me under the hood
        of that <span class="underline">old Chevrolet</span> settled in weeds
        at the end of the pasture.</p>

        <p>I'm the radiator that spent its years
        bolted in front of an engine
        <span class="underline">shoving me forward</span> into the wind.</p>

        <p>Whatever was in me in those days
        has mostly <span class="highlighted">leaked away</span>,
        but my cap's still screwed on tight</p>

        <p>and I know the names of all these
        tattered moths and <span class="underline">broken grasshoppers</span>
        the rest of you've forgotten.</p>
      </div>

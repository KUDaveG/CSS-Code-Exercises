<!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: Backgrounds
In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to apply backgrounds to different sections of the layout.
CSS can be placed in a separate file, in the <head> section of this document, or inline.

Try these things:
1) Go to subtlepatterns.com and select a pattern to apply to the background of the page.
   Make sure it repeats in all directions.

2) Give the main <div> a height and width. Add a colored background to that <div>.
Bonus: center that <div> on the page!

3) Highlight the two words "mank" and "ind" with the same color.

Bonus points: Use the Google box and figure out how to apply a gradient as a background color!

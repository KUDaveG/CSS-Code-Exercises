<!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: The Box Model
In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to apply backgrounds to different sections of the layout.
CSS can be placed in a separate file, in the <head> section of this document, or inline.

Try these things:
1) Make each step stand out - make the text bold and/or add some margin around it (top and bottom, perhaps?)

2) Take each box and give them a border around all sizes.

3) Apply some padding to each box to keep the text away from the edges.
Bonus: make the padding different on all 4 sides (ex: top-20px; right-10px; bottom-75px; left-50px;)

4) Apply margins around the boxes so they don't crash into each other.

5) Give the boxes a width and center them on the page.

6) Give each box a different background color. Bonus: use a tiled image instead of a color.

Bonus points: Use the Google box and figure out how to apply a gradient as a background color!

      <h1>How to Make Perfect Soft-Boiled or Hard-Boiled Eggs</h1>

      <div class="box1">
            <p>Step 1: Choose older eggs.<br />
            "What do my egg choices have to do with easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs?" you might be wondering. Turns out older eggs peel more easily. I'm not suggesting that you dig through the egg case for the oldest lay date, because a week's difference in supermarket eggs won't make a noticeable difference in the peeling of your hard-boiled eggs. But if you typically source your eggs from the farmers market or your neighborhood chickens (lucky you) than you'll want to let those eggs sit in the fridge for a week.
            <br />
            As eggs age they gradually lose moisture through the pores in their shell, and the air pocket at the tip expands. The pH of the egg's outer membrane (a thin layer of protein between the shell and the egg white) also changes, going from a low pH to a relatively high pH, which makes them adhere less strongly to the shell.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box2">
            <p>Step 2: Steam your eggs.<br />
              Two unconventional methods will give you easy-to-peel hard-cooked eggs, and both involve steaming. The first is a simple stovetop steam, where a few inches of water is brought to a boil and a steamer basket of eggs is lowered into the pot. Let the eggs steam for 20 minutes.
              <br />
              The second method is pressure steaming. The eggs are cooked on a steamer basket or rack inside a stovetop or electric pressure cooker. Reportedly, in both cases, the steam vapor enters the shell, loosening the membrane that is responsible for hard-to-peel eggs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box3">
            <p>Step 3: Cool the eggs completely.<br />
              Shocking hard-boiled eggs — that is plummeting them into a bowl of ice water — right after boiling also makes an easier-to-peel egg. The rapid cooling of the eggs contracts the egg whites, releasing them from the egg's membrane. It also firms the egg white proteins, making them easier to peel. Cool the eggs for at least 15 minutes for even easier peeling.</p>
      </div>
